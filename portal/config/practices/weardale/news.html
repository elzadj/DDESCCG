    <p>The Weardale Practice asked a group of year 9 students at Wolsingham School and Community College to describe the practice and its location within Weardale.</p>
    <p><strong>Alex Raine</strong> was selected as the winner with the following entry:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Swimming amidst the gulf stream lies the gentle giant of Great Britain, in which lies the vast green space that is England.  Resting north east in this collection of hills and fields is a place called County Durham.  The north of England consists of peaceful and tranquil villages and towns which are inhabited by a people of a mining history, nature reclaims these pits and they become overgrown with the hardy grass which grows in the valleys and on the hills.  These mines collapse and with them they entomb the ghosts of generations of sons, fathers and grandfathers.   These mines burrow deep into the massive rolling hills that surround villages and leak some of the cleanest water in existence down into the forests.  Water snakes along cracks and crevices, in amongst trees and rocks.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by trees and wildlife sits a village, one of the most rustic and beautiful villages around called Wolsingham.  The residents go about their daily lives happy in the knowledge that they live in an area of outstanding natural beauty.  The houses built there are constructed from sandstone and wood, both of which are plentiful in this area.  Rising above all the hustle and bustle of village life, the wooden giants known as the elephant trees.  These sentient guardians have kept watch over the dales for many years.  They watch as the world changes and bear silent witness to the daily events of the Dales.</p>
        <p>Amidst the rural environment that surrounds it, Stanhope medical centre stands proud, showing that the British people can live in a very sentimental and traditional way but they can still keep up with modern times.  It shows that the countryside can control the amount of urbanization and retain its peaceful charm and personality.  If anything the Weardale medical practice is a beacon that indicates that the north is capable of remembrance.  Something scarcely seen in the new Britain and it is therefore, very important.</p>
